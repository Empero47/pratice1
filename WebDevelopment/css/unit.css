/* 
CSS Units

CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, 
padding, font-size, etc.
Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these 
will appear as exactly that size.
Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen 
sizes vary so much. However, 
they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
Relative length units scale  better between different rendering medium.
