# Getting started with Frameworks and Librarys

## What is a Framework?

A framework in programming is a toll that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development.

## What is a Library?

A library is a collection of objects and functions that can be used individually and must be configured to work together.

A programming library is a collection of prewritten code that programmers can use to optimize tasks. This collection of reusable code is usually targeted for specific common problems. A library usually includes a few different pre-coded components.

## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typograph, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

## Why do we used Bootstrap in CSS?

Bootstrap enables designers and developers to build completely responsive website quickly.

## Layout

1. Breakpoints: are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.
2. Containers: are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

## Navbar

Responsive navigation header - includes:

1. support for branding.
2. navigation links
3. support for collapse plugin

## Supported content

1. .navbar-brand - for your company, product, or project name
2. .navbar-nav - for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns)
3. .navbar-toggler - for use with the collapse plugin and navigation toggling behaviors.

4. Flex and spacing utilities for any form controls and actions
5. .navbar-text - for adding vertically centered string of text
6. .collapse .navbar-collapse - For grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.

## Carousel

Carousel is a slideshow component for cycling through elements - images or slides of text.

## How it works

1. The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes support for prev/next controls indicators.

## Cards

Bootstrap cards provide a flexible and extensible content container with multiple variants and options. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of cont, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. 

## Forms
1. form control
2. select
3. Checks & radios
4. Range
5. Input group
6. Floating labels
7. Layout
8. Validation

### Form controls

Form controls are styled with a mix of Sass and CSS variables, allowing them to adapt to color modes and support any customization method.

### Select
Improve browser default select elements with a custom initial appearance

### Checks & radios
Use Bootstrap custom radio buttons and checkboxes in forms for selecting input options.

### Range
Replace Browser default range inputs with Bootstrap custom version

### Input group
Attach labels and buttons to your inputs for increased semantic value.

### Floating labels
Create beautifully simple form labels that float over your input fields.

### Layout
Create Inline, horzontal, or complex grid-based layout with your forms

### Validation
Validate your forms with custom or native validation behaviors and styles.

## Modal

Use Bootstrap's JavaScript modal plugin to add dialogs to your website for lightboxes, user notifications, or completely custom content.

### How it works
1. Modals are built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They're positioned over everything else in the document and remove scroll from the <body> so that the modal content scrolls instead.
2. Clicking on the modal "backdrop" will automatically close the modal.
3. Bootstrap only supports one modal window at a time.
4. Modal use position: fixed, which can sometimes be a bit particular about is rendering. Whenever possible, place your modal HTML in a top-level position to avoid potential interference from other elements.
